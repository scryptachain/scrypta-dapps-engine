# Abstract

With this engine you will be able to fetch dApp assets from Scrypta Blochain and IPFS, serving it locally.

Those files will be uploaded by developers on our Developer Portal (which isn't active yet). 

After you've downloaded the dependencies with ``` npm install ``` and started the engine with ``` npm run dev ``` you will be able to see our minimal dapp here: http://localhost:3000/LdRQokR1i3XDtj1V3jnCRqMPrVc7sYkeE2
